# It is used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
# Example: Database connection, Logger, Configuration settings

#     The Singleton class can be implemented in different ways in Python. Some
#     possible methods include: base class, decorator, metaclass. We will use the
#     metaclass because it is best suited for this purpose.
