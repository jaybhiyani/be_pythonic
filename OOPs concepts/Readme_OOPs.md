Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. By understanding the core OOP principles (classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction), programmers can leverage the full potential of Python OOP capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.

OOPs Concepts in Python
- Class in Python
- Objects in Python
- Polymorphism in Python
- Encapsulation in Python
- Inheritance in Python
- Data Abstraction in Python

Class:
It is a collection of attributes, properties and methods. A blueprint for creating the objects of that type
A user defined template for creating the instances of a type. bundles data and functions together, making it easier to manage and use them

Object:
Object is the realtime thing of a class an instance of the type class which actually exists in the memory and have real values to the properties and attributes of the class as well as methods can actually be called using the object
ex: obj.CallingSomeMethod()

Class variables and Instance variables

Class Variables
These are the variables that are shared across all instances of a class. It is defined at the class level, outside any methods. All objects of the class share the same value for a class variable unless explicitly overridden in an object.

Instance Variables
Variables that are unique to each instance (object) of a class. These are defined within __init__ method or other instance methods. Each object maintains its own copy of instance variables, independent of other objects.

```python
class Dog:
    # Class variable
    species = "Canine"

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance variables
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create objects
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 5)

# Access class and instance variables
print(dog1.species)  # (Class variable)
print(dog1.name)     # (Instance variable)
print(dog2.name)     # (Instance variable)

# Modify instance variables
dog1.name = "Max"
print(dog1.name)     # (Updated instance variable)

# Modify class variable
Dog.species = "Feline"
print(dog1.species)  # (Updated class variable)
print(dog2.species)
```
